# This bfs program is an implementation on how to solve the following problem:

Suppose there are two types of professional wrestlers: “Babyfaces” (“good guys”) and “Heels” (“bad guys”). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have n wrestlers and we have a list of r pairs of rivalries.

Instructions on how to execute:
- To run wrestler.py, make sure that all the necessary test .txt files are in the same directory.
- To run in the terminal, type in "python3 wrestler.py"
- It will ask you to enter the text file you want to input, so you can enter in:
- "wrestler1.txt" without quotations and the program will run automatically and produce results to the screen
